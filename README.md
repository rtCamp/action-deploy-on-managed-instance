# Action Deploy on Managed Instance

Github action for deployment on managed instance.

[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

## Usage

1. Create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file in your GitHub repo, if one doesn't exist already.
2. Add the following code to the `deploy.yml` file.

```yml
on: push
name: Deploying WordPress Site
jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Deploy
      uses: docker://ghcr.io/rtcamp/action-deploy-on-managed-instance:latest
      env:
        SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
        NPM_VERSION: 7.20.5
        NODE_VERSION: 14.17.6
        BUILD_DIRECTORY: buildDirectory/
        BUILD_COMMAND: echo "buildCommand"
        BUILD_SCRIPT: path/to/custom/script.sh
        DEPLOY_LOCATIONS: ./locations.csv
        VIP: false
```

3. Create `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` secret using [GitHub Action's Secret](https://developer.github.com/actions/creating-workflows/storing-secrets) and store the private key that you use use to ssh to server(s) defined in `hosts.yml`.
4. Create `.github/hosts.yml` inventory file, based on [Deployer inventory file](https://deployer.org/docs/hosts.html#inventory-file) format. Make sure you explictly define GitHub branch mapping. Only the GitHub branches mapped in `hosts.yml` will be deployed, rest will be filtered out. Here is a sample [hosts.yml](https://github.com/rtCamp/wordpress-skeleton/blob/main/.github/hosts.yml).
